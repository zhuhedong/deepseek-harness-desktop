**DeepSeek Harness Desktop** is a community-maintained, open-source AI coding desktop client.

DeepSeek has not yet released a standalone official Desktop product. This project already combines the public official **DSH Runtime, Web UI, and the Desktop boundaries visible in the official repository** into an installable Windows application, then adds community plugins, Skills, task automation, Git, remote development, and desktop integration. It is not an official DeepSeek client and does not reuse or overwrite a future official Desktop identity, data directory, protocol, or update feed.

Supports **Windows 10 / 11 x64**, with **macOS arm64 / x64 Preview** and **Linux x64 Preview** builds. It is released under the **BSD-3-Clause** license.

The installer includes the main runtime components, so you do not need to separately configure Node.js, Git, or DSH.

### 4.2.1: sign-in, update, and extension-management reliability

The current Stable release is 4.2.1. It keeps the exact official DSH `0.1.6-alpha.2` pin and the source-verified dsh-web 0.3.23 cohort while addressing feedback from 4.2.0 without rewriting user conversations, projects, or third-party plugin contents.

- **ChatGPT sign-in completion**: browser authorization is one click, but Desktop reports success only after token exchange, account resolution, and local credential commit. Device-code login remains a visible fallback, and diagnostics exclude accounts, tokens, URLs, and provider response bodies.
- **Background updates**: the update window can be dismissed while the download remains alive in the background.
- **Unified navigation and identity**: Plugins, Skills, and model settings open their matching Extension Dock pages; the bai sign-in path remains promoted; the new light-blue character icon is used across the app and documentation.
- **Bounded overhead**: authorization waiting uses slower, non-overlapping polling and stops on terminal state or unmount.

### 4.1.0: let DeepSeek control the browser and computer

4.1.0 introduced Smart Control. Windows x64 is stable; macOS arm64 and Linux x64 are Preview builds. One GitHub Release is created only after all three platform jobs pass.

- **Browser Use** defaults to the official Playwright MCP in a visible, isolated system-browser session and discovers Chrome, Edge, or Chromium. Clicks, typing, uploads, and downloads remain approval-gated.
- **Computer Use** defaults to the bundled Cua Driver Native provider, with an external MCP fallback. Observation is separated from per-action approval, and repeated native startup failure recovers through safe mode.
- **Breaking DSH 0.1.6 compatibility** exact-pins `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.6-alpha.1` and adapts Agent, Session, PTC, Workflow, Sandbox, and Agent Team contracts.
- **Transactional 3.5/4.0 migration** preserves sessions and long context, workspaces, models, credential references, Skills, plugins, themes, pet settings, and collaboration settings, with backup and rollback.
- **Privacy-bounded metrics** use only fixed outcome vocabularies and exclude URLs, domains, window names, screenshots, prompts, tool arguments, paths, and credentials.

### Continuing core capabilities

- **Value Mode V2**: An expert controller model understands, decomposes, delegates, reviews, and synthesizes work while a subagent worker model handles bounded subtasks; first selection opens setup guidance.
- **Large-Model Usage Dashboard**: Balance, input/output tokens, context, cache, latency, cost, and generation speed are visible; peak speed uses a strict rolling one-second algorithm instead of treating one aggregate usage event as instantaneous throughput.
- **Claude Code / Codex Project Import**: Read-only discovery of projects and historical sessions, preview before import, centralized redaction, and non-executable historical tool calls.
- **More reliable startup and plugins**: Visible startup phases, transactional repair with rollback, and SafePluginBoundary isolation while existing DSH Home data and plugins continue to load directly.

## Model collaboration, Skills, and model access

The screenshots below come from the real final-candidate Electron acceptance environment for 4.0.0.

### Model collaboration: Agent Team and Value Mode in one place

The session sidebar opens the existing Extension Dock window directly on Model Collaboration. Agent Team handles multi-role coordination, while Value Mode separates controller and worker models. They remain independent and may be enabled separately or together.

![DeepSeek Harness Desktop 4.0.0 Model Collaboration page](docs/screenshots/desktop-4.0.0-rc.3/model-collaboration.png)

### Skills: one directory model across the conversation and Skill Center

Desktop 4 scans project `.dsh/skills`, user DSH Skills, and user Agents Skills through one discovery contract. The composer can search and insert the same skills shown by Skill Center, including their source and scope.

![DeepSeek Harness Desktop 4.0.0 conversation Skills menu](docs/screenshots/desktop-4.0.0-rc.3/conversation-skills.png)

### bai provider: consistently promoted in model entry points

The chat picker, model settings, and collaboration controller/worker pickers share one ordering rule: user-pinned models first, then bai, followed by the existing provider order.

![DeepSeek Harness Desktop 4.0.0 bai model access](docs/screenshots/desktop-4.0.0-rc.3/bai-models.png)

See [Desktop architecture and capabilities](docs/desktop.md), [Upgrade and Rollback](docs/upgrade-and-rollback.md), and the [4.1 release notes](docs/launch/release-notes.md) for the implementation boundaries.

## Why DeepSeek Harness Desktop

### Ready to Use

Install the EXE and launch a complete Harness environment.

There is no need to manually prepare Node.js, Git, pnpm, or the DSH Runtime. The desktop app manages the required components and runtime environment for you.

### Complete AI Coding Workspace

Use one desktop app for:

- AI conversations and code changes
- Project file browsing and editing
- Git / SCM operations
- Markdown, HTML, code, Diff, PDF, Office, and other file previews
- Model switching and reasoning-effort controls
- Skills and plugin usage
- Agent task execution
- Token and performance statistics
- Multi-project development workflows

### Skills and Plugin Ecosystem

Supports multiple extension paths:

- DSH Skills
- Agents Skills
- Project Skills
- Community DSH Bundles
- Plugin Marketplace
- Desktop extensions

Search, install, and use extensions directly inside Harness to build a development workflow that fits your needs.

### Task Board and Automation

The built-in Task Board organizes work as:

**Planned → Todo → In Progress → Completed / Failed**

Tasks can be executed through real DSH Agent Sessions and record Task Runs plus Evidence for later review and continuation.

Scheduled tasks and background execution are also supported for recurring development, maintenance, and automation workflows.

### Remote Development

The desktop app can work with both local and remote environments through:

- Mobile remote control
- SSH
- Web Terminal
- SFTP
- Port forwarding
- Multi-host cluster execution
- QQ Bot integration

You can connect to your Harness workspace from a PC, phone, or chat client.

### Personalized Desktop Experience

## Harness AI Coding Workspace

The desktop app runs the DeepSeek Harness Web Surface directly while the desktop host manages the local DSH Runtime.

In one window, you can handle AI conversations, code changes, file management, Git operations, task execution, model switching, and plugin extensions.

![DeepSeek Harness Desktop 3.3.0 main interface and AI coding workspace](docs/screenshots/3.3.0-workspace.webp)

## Skills and Plugins

Search and insert installed Skills directly from the conversation input.

Extension Dock supports:

- Community DSH Bundles
- Plugin Marketplace
- Project Skills
- DSH Skills
- Agents Skills

The desktop app uses an isolated `desktop` profile and does not overwrite an existing DSH setup.

Plugin installation, updates, and runtime lifecycle are managed by the desktop host.

## Codex Models and Reasoning Effort

3.0.9 uses the official `llm-pi-ai/openai-codex` authorization flow built into DSH RC.1 to complete ChatGPT OAuth and enable supported OpenAI Codex models inside Harness; it no longer loads the legacy `dsh-codex-connect` plugin that conflicts with native providers. The "ChatGPT Login" action in Settings starts OAuth with one click and continues in the system browser; the grant is only read or written by the official credential service and stays in the local DSH Home, so the frontend only learns whether you are signed in and never receives an access token or refresh token. It does not replace your current model by default, take over global search, or enable remote image tools.

When switching models, the desktop app shows the reasoning-effort levels supported by the active model and automatically handles valid configuration.

## Task Board and Automation

Use the Task Board to manage Agent work in one place.

| Board | Task details and scheduling |
| --- | --- |
| ![Task Board](docs/screenshots/09-task-board.png) | ![Scheduled task](docs/screenshots/10-task-board-detail-cron.png) |

Tasks can be executed through DSH Agent Sessions and save Task Run and Evidence records.

In addition to manual tasks, scheduled tasks and background execution can be used for recurring development, information processing, and maintenance workflows.

## Git Graph

Use the branch selector and Git graph to inspect branch relationships, commit history, repository status, and branch lanes at a glance.

![Git graph](docs/screenshots/04-git-graph.png)

## Files, Preview, and SCM

Project conversations include a complete right-side workspace:

- **File tree**: browse and search workspace files
- **File preview**: Markdown, HTML, code, Diff, CSV, PDF, Office, images, and text
- **Edit and save**: source / preview switching and split-view workflows
- **Git changes**: inspect real SCM state and run Stage / Unstage / Discard
- **Adjustable layout**: panel width and collapsed state can persist per project

![Right panel](docs/screenshots/19-right-panel.png)

## Mobile Remote Control

Scan the desktop QR code to connect a phone to the current Harness workspace.

The mobile interface can browse workspaces, create and view sessions, send and receive messages, switch models, adjust reasoning effort, and stay synchronized with the desktop app.

It works over the local network by default and can optionally use a public tunnel when needed.

| Workspaces | Sessions |
| --- | --- |
| ![Mobile workspaces](docs/screenshots/20-mobile-workspaces.png) | ![Mobile sessions](docs/screenshots/21-mobile-sessions.png) |
| **Mobile chat** | **Model and reasoning effort** |
| ![Mobile chat](docs/screenshots/22-mobile-chat.png) | ![Model selector](docs/screenshots/23-mobile-model-sheet.png) |

## SSH Remote Development

The built-in SSH panel can manage remote servers directly and share connection settings with the Agent.

Supported capabilities include:

- Web Terminal
- SFTP upload / download
- Local port forwarding
- Multi-host cluster execution
- Importing hosts from `~/.ssh/config`
- Using configured remote hosts directly from Agent conversations

Harness can therefore work with remote servers and development environments as well as local projects.

## QQ Bot Integration

The desktop app integrates the Tencent QQ Bot Connector.

Bind it from Extension Dock by scanning a QR code, then connect QQ direct messages and group chats to the local Harness instance.

Connection information is managed by the desktop host without requiring manual configuration-file editing.

## Large-Model Usage Dashboard and Performance Statistics

The input area can display:

- Rolling one-second generation speed and per-step peak
- LLM request latency
- Context usage
- Cache hit rate
- Input Tokens
- Output Tokens

![Historical 3.2.0 capture: large-model usage dashboard and rolling one-second peak](docs/screenshots/3.2.0-usage-dashboard.webp)

## Themes and Skins

The desktop app includes multiple themes with preview-before-apply support.

Available styles include Harbor, Windows XP / Luna, Minecraft-inspired, Blue Fantasy, Whale Song, Miku, Trading Terminal, QQ nostalgia, and more.

![Skin Center](docs/screenshots/03-settings-skin-center.png)

### Whale-girl Desktop Pet

The built-in whale-girl desktop pet changes animations based on Agent states such as thinking, working, waiting, and completion.

It also supports interaction, naming, dragging, and hiding.

| Companion mode | Interaction panel |
| --- | --- |
| ![Whale-girl pet](docs/screenshots/11-pet-new-chat.png) | ![Pet interaction panel](docs/screenshots/12-pet-panel.png) |

### Full-page Particle Theme

The particle-whale theme can be applied not only to the startup page but also to the main Harness interface, automatically adjusting visual effects around input state, dialogs, background activity, and the system reduced-motion preference.

## Download and Install

### Windows

1. Open [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ningbainb/deepseek-harness-desktop/releases/latest).
2. Download `DeepSeek-Harness-Desktop-Setup-<version>-x64.exe`.
3. Run the installer.
4. Launch **DeepSeek Harness Desktop**.

The Windows installer already includes DSH, desktop plugins, skins, pnpm, MinGit, and the required native dependencies. Separate Node.js or Git setup is not required.

### macOS unsigned preview

Apple Silicon downloads the `-arm64` package. Intel Macs download the `-x64` package. After downloading the `.dmg` or `.zip`, move the app to `/Applications` and clear quarantine with `xattr`. macOS 15 no longer has Right-click > Open. Preview builds have no auto-update and use system Git. Full steps: [macOS unsigned preview install guide](docs/macos-preview.md).

If GitHub downloads are slow in your region, you can also join the community group at the top of this page to get the synchronized installer.

## Updates

DeepSeek Harness Desktop supports in-app update checks. When a new version is available, you can review the release information and choose whether to upgrade.

Two update channels are available:

- **Stable**: the default channel and the best choice for most users.
- **Beta**: opt-in access to newer features.

Upgrades are designed to preserve existing DSH_HOME, Desktop Profile, community Bundles, Skills, skin configuration, and desktop-pet state whenever possible.

- [Compatibility policy](docs/compatibility-policy.md)
- [Runtime support policy](docs/runtime-support-policy.md)
- [Full release notes](docs/launch/release-notes.md)

## Security and Privacy

DeepSeek Harness Desktop is designed to keep user data and the runtime environment local whenever possible.

Key behaviors include:

- DSH Runtime listens on loopback by default
- The main desktop surface and extension capabilities use separate permission boundaries
- External links open in the system browser
- OAuth, QQ Bot, and other credentials stay local
- Telemetry is disabled by default
- Diagnostic information is exported only when the user explicitly requests it
- Exported diagnostics redact sensitive content such as Tokens, Secrets, Cookies, paths, Prompts, Sessions, and Tool Results
