# DeepSeek Harness Desktop

DeepSeek Harness Desktop is maintained by repository owner **ningbai牛逼** (`ningbainb`) with contributions from the community.

## Architecture

The desktop application is a lifecycle and security layer around the official DSH host. Desktop 4.1.0 validates the packaged `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.6-alpha.1` CLI as its installation anchor, then composes the `desktop` Profile through the public official app-boot, command-line, HTTP-proxy, launch-environment, settings, session, workspace, renderer, tool, Browser Use, and Computer Use SDKs. The Web application, protocols, data paths, and tools remain official DSH implementations; Desktop owns the native host, immutable Runtime baseline, permissions surface, and transactional boundary around community plugin dependencies.

The community Desktop home is `DSH_HOME` when explicitly supplied or `~/.dsh-community` by default. The desktop app runs the managed `~/.dsh-community/profiles/desktop` profile, which composes `@deepseek-ai/dsh-base`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app`, `@linxin666/dsh-web-ui-all`, `@tencent-connect/dsh-qqbot`, and `reasoning-slider` while preserving community bundles already added to that profile. DSH 0.1.6 provides the native Codex model adapter through `@deepseek-ai/dsh-base`; the retired standalone Codex providers are removed from Desktop-managed profiles to prevent duplicate provider registration. The native Extension Dock market fetches the public awesome-dsh-plugin index and sends confirmed installs through Desktop's transactional plugin manager; it is not a Runtime bundle. Packaged plugin directories are linked into the profile's `node_modules`; this is runtime package resolution, not a second configuration store. The official Desktop remains free to use its own `~/.dsh` home and package graph.

Desktop 4 also owns a distinct application id, installer GUID, private package name, `dsh-community://` operating-system protocol, and `ningbainb/deepseek-harness-desktop` GitHub update feed. Those boundaries prevent a later official Desktop installer or updater from replacing the community application. An eligible 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5 community Home is copied transactionally into `~/.dsh-community`; source bytes remain in `~/.dsh`, generated dependencies are rebuilt, and the migration commits only after the rebuilt Runtime passes health checks. The old community installer location is adopted only when its private shutdown marker and executable are both present, and its legacy registry identity is retired only after the new installation commits.

## Desktop 4 platform policy

DeepSeek has not yet released a standalone official Desktop product. The 4.1 community edition integrates the public official DSH Runtime, Web UI, split SDKs, Browser Use, Computer Use, and the Desktop boundaries visible in the official repository at the recorded upstream commit. This is source-based compatibility work, not access to unreleased private code. The community application remains distinct through its application id, installer identity, `~/.dsh-community` home, `dsh-community://` protocol, and `ningbainb/deepseek-harness-desktop` update feed, so it cannot impersonate or overwrite a future official Desktop installation.

Desktop 4.1 retains grouped Dock settings, shared project/workspace dialogs, model-driven file handoff, visible local memory activity, plugin recovery, collaboration, and consistent Skills discovery. It adds a Smart Control center for Browser Use and Computer Use, platform-aware provider discovery, observation/action approval separation, and safe-mode recovery after repeated native driver failure. See the [Smart Control guide](smart-control.md). New public integrations must use the documented Desktop contracts and official split SDK services rather than infer behavior from the internal Electron implementation.

The Desktop Client SDK and Desktop Contract remain 1.x. Runtime Provider, Preset, Project/Task/Run/Evidence, Deep Link, plugin compatibility, Runtime matrix, and compat-patch inputs have machine-readable definitions. The applicable additive-change, deprecation, and major-version rules are in the [compatibility policy](compatibility-policy.md) and [schema versioning guide](schema-versioning.md).

Stable Runtime selection is evidence-led: a Stable build and startup accept only `known-good` or `supported` matrix entries that satisfy the documented provider, Desktop range, integrity, lockfile, and patch conditions. `candidate` creates evidence only, and `blocked` cannot become a fallback. See the [Runtime support policy](runtime-support-policy.md) for the matrix fields, support windows, and upstream-change process.

Startup reads the current Home and persistent Desktop Profile directly. It tries the complete plugin graph twice, may run a bounded model-backed repair in a private transaction workspace, verifies every candidate before applying it, and otherwise starts built-in plugins from the same Home. It does not require a startup migration, isolated recovery session, or safe-mode choice. The exact fallback and rollback boundaries are documented in [upgrade and rollback](upgrade-and-rollback.md).

Official packaged Desktop releases enable first-party anonymous product analysis for activity, retention, country-level adoption, versions, updates, and fixed feature outcomes. Rotating daily/monthly actors and a stable anonymous installation hash are independent of DSH accounts, hardware, sessions, and credentials. Current fixed feature events cover project and file outcomes, Skills, Dock settings, Agent Team, local LAN access, Value Mode, and coarse plugin operations. These independent observations do not prove ordered funnel completion or completed model tasks. Development, source, test, and Fork builds stay disconnected. Desktop never automatically uploads diagnostics; a redacted JSON/ZIP is exported only after confirmation to a user-selected location. See the [privacy policy](../PRIVACY.md), [metric definitions](../apps/dsh-telemetry-worker/README.md), and [security boundaries](security-boundaries.md).

## Included desktop capabilities

| Area | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime | One persistent official DSH host using the real `DSH_HOME` and `profiles/desktop`, random loopback port, HTTP readiness probe, graceful process-tree stop, bounded automatic restart, and an explicit `--no-open`; Windows window suppression stays at spawn level and the wrapper tracks the real GUI-subsystem Runtime PID |
| Web surface | Original DSH Web application and complete dsh-web-ui plugin/skin aggregate |
| Native sidebar layout | Fullscreen panels reserve the Desktop caption and workbench controls; native splitting, floating and docking retain independent browser tab drafts |
| Conversation continuity | FIFO next-turn queue, automatic continuation after cancellation, normalized user-cancellation feedback |
| Model recovery | Bounded backoff for rate limits, timeouts, network loss, and retryable server errors; immediate manual cancellation |
| Recovery | Status-only startup, one unchanged full-profile retry, bounded transactional model repair, verified apply/rollback, then same-Home built-ins fallback |
| Plugins | Immutable Desktop-owned Runtime baseline, compatible/unknown/incompatible admission, isolated staging, protected direct and transitive graph validation, one persistent writer, atomic install/update/remove/batch/Preset activation, health-gated commit, crash recovery, and quiet PluginUIState projection |
| Presets | Review-only file ingress, bounded archive validation, integrity and trust summary, staged multi-surface rollback |
| Skills | Project/DSH/Agents root discovery, safe folder import, searchable conversation menu, recent-use ordering, full keyboard control |
| Reasoning | Sticky disclosure control keeps long reasoning collapsible without scrolling back to its start |
| SSH operations | Three-second Linux telemetry for CPU, memory, disk, load, processes, and failed services, plus confirmed process and systemd actions |
| Window | Single instance, persisted visible main geometry, native menu, download destination prompt; movable/resizable settings panel with minimum and persisted bounds; explicit quit/minimize-to-tray/ask close behavior |
| Community | Help-menu QQ group QR and one-click join, direct GitHub issue feedback |
| Updates | Stable is the default update channel; Beta is an explicit prerelease channel. GitHub Releases remain first and default, downloads remain backgrounded, and installation still needs user confirmation; neither channel automatically downgrades |
| Smart Control | Browser Use and Computer Use default off; Playwright and Cua Driver providers are platform-probed, observations are separated from mutating actions, and repeated native failures recover through a preserved-config safe mode |
| Upgrade and diagnostics | 3.5/4.0 Profiles migrate through a versioned backup, fingerprint, staged health check, commit, and rollback transaction. Diagnostics are user-initiated, redacted JSON/ZIP exports only |
| Update handoff | Token-bound shutdown receipt v2, verified runtime/extension quiescence, constrained legacy cleanup fallback |
| Renderer bridge | Contract v1.2 capability discovery, structured notifications, browser-safe Desktop client SDK, split main/extension preloads, sender-identity enforcement |
| OS integration | Strict `dsh-community://` route allowlist with input-only `dsh://` 3.x compatibility, `.dshpreset` preview association, deduplicated foreground-aware notifications, and main-window-only workspace file opening |
| Task Board | Host-owned v3 Projects/Task Runs/Evidence ledger, copy-first v2 migration, explicit Worktree review, ID-only Host routes, SSE synchronization, and an opt-in durable Host scheduler with browser fallback |
| Value Mode | Expert controller model for top-level sessions, configured worker model for subagent sessions, first-use setup guide, Saver/Balanced/Powerful strategies, one-level delegation cap, and controller/worker call analytics |
| Live usage | Input/output token accounting, context/cache/latency/cost projection, valid streaming samples, rolling one-second rate and per-step peak, with legacy average-rate values ignored |
| Context handoff import | Read-only discovery for Claude Code and Codex projects/sessions, streaming tolerant JSONL parser, centralized secret redaction, token-bounded Handoff prompt generator, atomic ledger, and legitimate DSH session bridge |
| Visual system | Solid native/injected title-bar alignment, system-style Extension Dock, bounded particle-whale startup surface, page-aware full-interface particle theme |
| Security | Sandbox, context isolation, no Node integration, per-window preload APIs, sender registry, loopback navigation allowlist, denied permissions |

## Windows startup and recovery

The Windows invocation retains a hidden PowerShell console host for Runtime output and restricted-token shell descendants, but it does not pass PowerShell's `-WindowStyle Hidden` command-line option. On Windows PowerShell 5.1, that option combined with Electron Node mode and no console handle can cause the Runtime, including `--version`, to exit silently with `0xFFFFFFFF`; Electron's spawn-level `windowsHide` remains the window-suppression mechanism. The wrapper launches the GUI-subsystem Electron Runtime through `ProcessStartInfo`, inherits the captured output handles, reports the direct Runtime PID over an internal control line, and waits for that process. Shutdown applies `taskkill /T /F` to the registered Runtime PID rather than only the wrapper, so the Runtime and its descendants are reclaimed before the wrapper exits.

Startup also normalizes legacy empty-object, empty-list, and comment-only patch files before profile resolution. A status-subscription or startup IPC failure is converted to a recoverable startup state rather than leaving the renderer at its initial 8% progress. The sanitized Runtime log remains the diagnostic source when readiness does not arrive.

If an interrupted plugin transaction has a missing, malformed, or integrity-mismatched recovery archive, Desktop preserves the active journal, snapshot, and full Profile without attempting to restore unverified bytes. The complete Profile remains blocked from further mutation, while the same-Home built-in Profile starts so the application and diagnostic export stay available. Diagnostics expose only the fixed `plugin-archive-recovery` stage, reason code, transaction phase, and archive source; they never export transaction identifiers, snapshot identifiers, paths, or raw errors. After the user exports diagnostics and explicitly runs **Extension Dock > Recovery > Repair plugin environment**, Desktop backs up the old Profile, builds and starts a fresh Profile, and only then renames the blocked active marker into quarantine. The original journal, snapshot, and Profile backup remain intact; a failed reset leaves the active marker in place and rolls the Profile back.

After a one-time native confirmation, the single primary Runtime runs with `danger-full-access` and approval policy `never` under the current Windows user. This does not request administrator rights or change PATH, the registry, or system permissions. The authorization is durable until revoked, while official Runtime support and file integrity are rechecked on every launch. Startup never creates a temporary or isolated Home.

Desktop writes its fixed full-user overlay under `<userData>/runtime-overlays`, outside user configuration, with atomic replacement and read-back verification. The renderer and plugins cannot supply that path or content. The primary invocation contains exactly one `--no-open`, so the Runtime cannot launch the system browser; Electron loads the detected loopback URL in the main window.

## Using Desktop 4.1

1. Use the conversation sidebar's Smart Control entry to configure Browser Use or Computer Use, run a safe provider test, and inspect platform permissions. Both capabilities remain off until explicitly enabled. Open the Extension Dock to connect a model or configure Value Mode; existing plugin, import, backup, and repair entries remain available.
2. Use Add workspace to open Create project, enter a name, and click the source-folder area to open the system folder picker. Choose workspace uses the shared dialog to connect a directory; an already connected directory opens its existing workspace.
3. Drag ordinary files into the conversation or use Add files. Wait for the attachment cards to finish adding, then send your request. Files are stored under the current workspace and passed as real references; the model chooses tools to inspect them. Desktop does not parse every file or convert it to Markdown, and accepting a file does not guarantee a model can interpret its format. Images use the separate compression and vision path.
4. Open Personal preferences > Memory in the Dock to review saved items, confirm suggestions, and inspect recently prepared memory context. The panel describes request preparation, not proof that the model adopted a memory. Enable memory references to send relevant matches to the selected model provider; see [personalization boundaries](#personalization-and-remote-data-boundaries).
5. Browser and file-preview panels provide their own close control. Closing a preview returns to the conversation. For the one-time upgrade Star prompt, see [upgrade behavior](upgrade-and-rollback.md#star-prompt-after-upgrading).

Model-directory recovery events are coalesced for 30 seconds, so reopening the model selector, a parent-render callback identity change, or briefly switching window focus does not repeatedly reload the same data. In the Extension Dock, community-catalog and plugin-version reads run independently from plugin mutation transactions: cached catalog reads return immediately for five minutes, concurrent requests join one operation, and explicit refresh still revalidates the source. Update, market, and registry diagnostics are probed in parallel under independent timeouts, so one slow endpoint does not add its full wait to the other two. A slow or unavailable catalog therefore does not disable unrelated Dock controls.

The built-in QQ Bot integration is pinned to `@tencent-connect/dsh-qqbot@0.5.0`. Desktop also packages the matching DSH 0.1.6 user-approval service, allowing QQ conversations to answer supported approval prompts while preserving the existing encrypted credential store, profile isolation, and transactional bind or unbind rollback.

## Model collaboration, usage, and import

These capabilities remain available in 4.1. The screenshots below are historical 3.2.0 captures; current Smart Control, collaboration, Skills, and model navigation are represented by the accepted 4.1.0 and 4.0.0 captures above.

### Value Mode routing

Selecting Value Mode opens a non-blocking configuration guide. The current default model is preselected as the expert controller when no explicit controller is saved. The user chooses a subagent worker model and a strategy before enabling the mode. Top-level sessions use the expert controller; sessions created with the subagent origin use the worker model. The controller decides whether delegation is worthwhile, and the worker cannot recursively delegate or call expert consultation.

### Usage dashboard semantics

The live stats projection separates billing correction from streaming throughput. A valid output increment plus its event time is the only instantaneous sample. Samples sharing a millisecond are coalesced, and each sample counts the output tokens in the inclusive one-second window ending at that sample. The UI labels the result as a rolling one-second peak; a session with no valid streamed sample shows no fabricated TPS.

### Context handoff semantics

Claude Code and Codex directories are scanned read-only. The user can preview project matching and session rows before confirming import. Imported messages and tool results are historical, marked non-executable, redacted through the central pipeline, and recorded in an idempotent ledger so retries do not duplicate sessions.

### Conversation compaction

The official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-base` bundle exposes `/compact` in an active conversation. The command asks the official compaction service for one useful reduction below the automatic threshold; Desktop does not simulate compaction by deleting messages. A successful compaction retains the append-only original event history, replaces an earlier balanced model-visible span with a summary checkpoint, keeps the recent tail, and does not split tool-call/result pairs. Busy, changed-session, summary-generation, commit, and persistence failures remain visible and retryable instead of silently discarding history.

### Personalization and remote data boundaries

The optional Personal Prompt and Memory bundles are disabled by default. Memory remains in the local DSH profile, is written only after an explicit user action or confirmation, and can be searched, edited, deleted, or cleared. Personal Prompt profiles remain in profile settings and, when enabled, become request context sent to the currently selected model Provider. Remote mobile access is paired to a device and checked against Workspace and Session ownership; the default non-loopback full `/api` is denied.
The packaged Desktop Runtime binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. The Electron
launcher can pass `DSH_DESKTOP_REMOTE_HOST=0.0.0.0` only when the official DSH
runtime explicitly supports all-interface binding; the current official
runtime rejects that value for safety, and this project does not bypass the
guard. For a phone test on the current runtime, use the paired mobile-only
route through the configured auto-tunnel or a private/manual tunnel. Pairing,
Workspace/Session ownership, and revoke remain active.

### Proxy routing and diagnostics

Desktop uses the operating-system proxy by default. A recognized command-line routing flag takes precedence: `--proxy-server=...`, `--proxy-pac-url=...`, `--proxy-auto-detect`, or `--no-proxy-server`; `--proxy-bypass-list=...` supplies its bypass list. For managed launches, `DSH_DESKTOP_PROXY_MODE` accepts `system`, `direct`, `auto_detect`, or `pac_script`, while `DSH_DESKTOP_PROXY_PAC_URL`, `DSH_DESKTOP_PROXY_RULES`, and `DSH_DESKTOP_NO_PROXY` provide PAC, fixed-server, and bypass values. If those are absent, `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`, including their lowercase forms, provide the fixed-server configuration.

API, update, and market traffic can override that common setting independently with `DSH_DESKTOP_API_*`, `DSH_DESKTOP_UPDATE_*`, or `DSH_DESKTOP_MARKET_*`, using the same `PROXY_MODE`, `PROXY_PAC_URL`, `PROXY_RULES`, and `NO_PROXY` suffixes. Precedence is command line, scope-specific environment, Desktop-wide environment, conventional proxy environment, then the system default. Command-line proxy flags remain process-wide because Chromium consumes them before Desktop starts.

The update policy is applied and awaited on the default Electron Session used by the updater, while update probes use a separate Session with the same policy. Community catalog requests, NPM manifest checks, and managed Git downloads use a market-only Session. Fixed market rules that can be represented as `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` are also passed to the pnpm installation child; PAC and auto-detect cannot be translated to that child and are reported as unverified instead of applied. Authentication challenges, invalid PAC, request cancellation, and DNS failures have bounded return paths on the isolated probe/market Sessions; resetting those connections does not interrupt the main conversation Session.

The Extension Dock recovery page provides an explicit connectivity check for update, community catalog, and NPM manifest endpoints. It labels model API and the on-demand pnpm installer as not probed instead of generating credentialed model calls or a fake install. The explicit engineering command `pnpm --dir apps/dsh-desktop test:plugin-proxy:e2e` separately installs a fixed public plugin into a disposable project and empty store through an allowlisted loopback proxy, proving the production pnpm child honors the market projection without turning that network operation into a routine UI probe. The redacted diagnostic package separately records each scope's mode, rule kinds and counts, bypass count, PAC presence, application status, and transport limitation. Neither surface records endpoints, user names, passwords, or raw proxy errors. The DSH Runtime receives direct/fixed proxy environment projections for API traffic, but each Provider, community plugin, or external process still decides whether it honors them. Electron proxy settings and environment variables therefore do not prove that model API or arbitrary plugin traffic used the proxy, and they are not a network sandbox. There is currently no per-session offline switch backed by official tool and sandbox enforcement, so Desktop does not expose a decorative switch that would imply stronger isolation.

### Built-in surfaces and conversation operations

Long conversations keep the composer seat fixed while the official conversation scrollport moves. The floating turn navigator uses user-message boundaries for previous and next navigation; its bottom action reports the final turn when the scrollport reaches the floor. The Explorer context action and internal file-tree drag insert a workspace-relative path reference into the draft. Preview remains a separate local view. External text and code files below 1 MB may add fenced text to the draft, but Word, PDF, spreadsheet, archive, binary, and larger files add only a path link; none of these draft changes reaches the model until the user sends the message.

The whale pet is an optional local activity and interaction surface. Clicking pets it; its hover controls feed or hide it, and the conversation input dock can summon a hidden pet. Disabling the plugin hides the surface and stops its refresh work. It does not grant the model tools or change session execution.

Task Board opens from its sidebar row. The visible **Back to chat** button is a normal keyboard-focusable button and returns the center column to the conversation; choosing a native sidebar destination or another full-column surface also closes the board. Closing the board does not delete tasks or running task sessions.

The current official Runtime distinguishes archive, registration deletion, and branch. Archiving a conversation removes it from grouping surfaces while retaining its persisted session log and Workspace account. Deleting a Workspace removes only that registration and its session account; it never deletes the directory, user files, live Sessions, or persisted logs. Desktop exposes no operation that claims to delete a session log. **Branch into a new conversation** is available only on the final assistant message of a completed turn; it copies the durable prefix through that boundary into a child session with lineage metadata, opens the child, and leaves the source unchanged.

## Performance and size

Reference measurements on the Windows 11 development machine for version 2.0.0:

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Managed runtime packages | 22 |
| Fresh profile preparation, median | 22.3 ms |
| Unchanged profile preparation, median | 13.2 ms |
| Warm DSH readiness | about 2.8–3.0 seconds |
| First cold Windows file scan | about 25.2 seconds |

The release keeps the official DSH runtime, Chromium, terminal/native modules, SSH, remote UI, all built-in plugin packages, and all skins. The first start may be slower while Windows scans newly installed files. Later starts reuse both the installed files and profile links. Run `pnpm --filter @linxin666/dsh-desktop measure:profile` to reproduce the profile-only benchmark without network access.

## Installation

Download the x64 installer from GitHub Releases and verify its SHA-256 against `SHA256SUMS.txt`. Each published Release also provides `release-manifest.json`, which records the actual signature state for every artifact. An official community Release may be unsigned when no certificate is configured, in which case Windows may show an unknown-publisher or SmartScreen prompt. If `CSC_LINK`, `WIN_CSC_LINK`, or `CSC_NAME` is configured, the workflow automatically requires a valid Authenticode signature and timestamp and fails closed otherwise. The generated Release body reports the verified manifest state. The default per-user location is recommended. Custom installation roots should be kept short because some transitive native tooling still depends on the legacy Win32 260-character path limit.

Unsigned macOS contributor previews ship as separate Apple Silicon (arm64) and Intel (x64) packages. They are not notarized, do not include MinGit, and cannot use in-app updates. Install steps, Gatekeeper bypass (including the macOS 15 removal of Right-click > Open), and the contributor checklist are in the [macOS unsigned preview install guide](macos-preview.md).

No separate Node.js or pnpm installation is required for release users. Desktop creates the stable `<userData>/runtime-bin/pnpm.cmd` shim and places that directory first only in the child PATH for the primary Runtime, persistent plugin installer, and built-in terminal. The terminal and installer use `~/.dsh/profiles/desktop` as cwd and never depend on a temporary recovery Profile.

The installed app defaults to the Stable channel, checks its GitHub Release feed after startup and every six hours, then downloads a discovered release in the background. Beta is selected explicitly and may accept prereleases; Stable rejects prereleases. Switching channels never authorizes an automatic downgrade. Open `Help > Check for Updates` to check immediately. The update surface offers **Download from GitHub**, **Join user group**, and **Update later**. GitHub Releases is the only built-in/default transport. If GitHub is slow, the QR-backed QQ group `1105158177` provides a synchronized installer; the app does not enable or advertise third-party mirrors as a faster route. Administrators may explicitly opt in trusted HTTPS fallbacks through `DSH_DESKTOP_UPDATE_MIRRORS`, but those sources remain secondary to GitHub.

Installation still requires an explicit **Restart and install** action. Desktop stops and reaps the DSH child process before handing control to the installer. Automatic check failures remain in the desktop log; manual check failures are shown to the user.

## Close behavior and background automation

The lifecycle, Durable Host Scheduler ownership rules, and safe fallback behavior are specified in [Background mode and scheduler](background-and-scheduler.md).

Desktop persists one of **Quit**, **Minimize to tray and enable background automation**, or **Ask every time**. **Quit** is the default. Choosing **Ask every time** prompts at a normal main-window close, and choosing **Quit** from that prompt stops the app; it does not grant background scheduling permission.

Only the persistent **Minimize to tray and enable background automation** choice keeps the process and Runtime alive after the main window hides. The tray can restore the window, expose task/runtime status, open Extension Dock, check updates, or explicitly quit. Explicit quit, update installation, and crash handling bypass tray hiding and stop the Runtime. Desktop does not claim to execute schedules after the application has fully exited.

The persistent primary Runtime receives `DSH_DESKTOP_BACKGROUND_AUTOMATION=1` while Desktop is running, so the Task Board Host Scheduler can claim due slots through the Desktop Runtime Provider. The close preference decides whether Desktop and that Runtime remain alive after the main window hides; Quit still stops both and no schedule runs after process exit. A missing, malformed, or unavailable adapter leaves browser scheduling as the safe fallback. See [Task Board v3](task-board-v3.md) for task state and review behavior.

## Settings window and particle theme

The upstream settings dialog remains the settings implementation, while the desktop renderer adds window behavior around it. Drag its existing header to move it and use any edge or corner to resize it. Bounds are stored under the Desktop user-data directory and restored on reopen. A 520 × 360 minimum, responsive navigation/content layout, independent scrolling, viewport clamping, and resize/DPI revalidation keep controls visible without overlap or off-screen placement.

`@linxin666/dsh-particle-theme` is a normal Web UI bundle rather than a mutually exclusive skin. Its fixed, pointer-transparent canvas extends the startup whale language into the main interface. Page profiles reduce density, opacity, and speed while an editable control is focused or a dialog is open, stop animation for a hidden page, and honor `prefers-reduced-motion`. Users can disable the canvas or tune density, opacity, and speed in **Settings > Plugin config > Particle theme**. Device-pixel ratio is capped and sustained slow frames lower scene quality; new scenes can register through `ParticleThemeRegistry` without changing the page controller.

Skin Center v2 switches the active skin atomically in the current page and persists the selection for the next launch; it does not rewrite the Cordis patch or require a page reload. Its background occlusion and the empty/with-content blur controls are independent. Setting both blur values to zero removes the fixed blur layer while keeping a selected skin's artwork mounted. The regression entry `pnpm --filter @linxin666/dsh-desktop test:skin-center:e2e` verifies live Blue Fantasy activation, zero-occlusion artwork, zero-blur overlay safety, five full relaunches, and Electron device scale factors 1, 1.25, and 1.5. Command-line device scaling is automation evidence, not a substitute for a final packaged pass under physical Windows display settings.

## Extension Dock

Open `Tools > Extension Dock` from the native menu.

Plugin installation accepts an npm registry package such as `@scope/dsh-bundle@1.2.3`. URL, path, whitespace, shell metacharacter, and option-like input is rejected. The package must declare a DSH bundle patch. Built-in package versions are displayed but can change only with a tested Desktop release.

Opening Extension Dock checks only community packages for updates; normal application startup performs no registry requests. A candidate is assessed against the current Desktop, DSH runtime, Electron Node.js, and installed peer versions. Compatible versions can update directly, incompatible versions are blocked with a reason, and versions without enough metadata require explicit confirmation. The package is prefetched while DSH remains available, then switched to an exact version offline. If validation or restart fails, the previous manifest and lockfile are restored and the old runtime is restarted.

Existing user plugins in the persistent Desktop Profile are preserved and loaded even when registry, publisher, or compatibility metadata is absent. A user-selected new plugin is technically revalidated and installed directly into `profiles/desktop`, with a recoverable archive of package manifests, lockfiles, patches, and `node_modules` created before writes; installation or activation failure restores the archive and the previous Runtime.

A community bundle can declare `dsh.compatibility` for Desktop and Runtime ranges, Desktop API range, required capabilities, allowed renderer Surfaces, and bounded runtime-test evidence. Extension Dock displays the requirement and evidence, blocks mismatches, and writes the diagnostic profile record `~/.dsh/profiles/desktop/desktop-plugins.lock.json` atomically after inventory or startup reconciliation. The lock is derived evidence, not a package manager lockfile and not an authority that can promote an untested version.

The built-in Tencent QQ Bot integration is disabled until it is bound from Extension Dock. Binding uses the official QR connector inside the desktop main process. The AppSecret is encrypted with the operating-system credential store, is never sent to renderer code, and is supplied to the DSH child process only through its environment. Unbinding deletes the encrypted credential, disables the profile row, and restarts DSH.

Skill discovery scans project, custom, user DSH, and user Agents roots in explicit precedence order. Import copies one validated skill folder into `~/.dsh/skills` without overwriting an existing name; authoring, compatibility, link handling, and visible diagnostics are documented in [Desktop skills](skills.md).

The Preset tab exports and previews `.dshpreset` v1 without exposing a selected path to renderer code. Its plan shows Manifest metadata, integrity-only trust, required Secret names, capability gaps, exact package changes, skills, settings, templates, and conflicts. Import requires explicit confirmation and uses one Runtime stop/start transaction; details are in [Desktop Presets](presets.md).

The same tab can preview the fixed `profiles/web` source and selectively migrate compatible exact-version plugins into the isolated Desktop profile. It also identifies profile-patch configuration attributable to selected package names or bundle IDs, skips credential-bearing fragments, keeps values in the main process, and rolls the Desktop patch back with the package transaction. Missing, incompatible, non-exact, already-installed, and Desktop-managed entries remain visible and are handled separately instead of being silently copied.

After extension changes, Extension Dock presents a prominent Refresh action. Changes that alter the Runtime bundle graph also present **Restart DeepSeek Harness**, so the required follow-up is explicit.

Task Board v3 behavior is documented in [Task Board v3](task-board-v3.md), [Git Worktree execution and review](worktrees.md), [Task Runs and Evidence](task-runs-and-evidence.md), and [Runtime Provider capability fallback](provider-capability-fallback.md). Protocol, file-association, and notification boundaries are documented in [Desktop deep links, file association, and notifications](deep-links.md).

## Desktop client SDK and workspace file opening

The public SDK boundary, SemVer policy, normal-Web fallback, and bounded workspace-file external-open capability are specified in [Desktop Client SDK](desktop-client-sdk.md). Extension Dock and extension preloads do not receive the workspace-file capability.

## Local LAN mobile access

Desktop 4 keeps the official Runtime on its authenticated operating-system pipe. In the mobile remote-control panel, choose a listed private IPv4 address and enable local LAN access. After the native warning is accepted, Desktop listens only on that exact address and the displayed high port; it never asks the official Runtime to bind `0.0.0.0`. The QR opens the standalone `/m` phone page, consumes a one-time pairing token, and uses only device-authorized `/m/api` operations.

Use this only on a trusted private network. HTTP protects neither the local radio link nor a hostile shared network, so pairing tokens remain short-lived and single-use. Windows Firewall may ask whether to allow the application on Private networks; Public-network access should remain denied. If the selected adapter disappears or its address changes, reopen the panel and select a currently listed address. Disable local LAN access from the same panel when it is no longer needed; Desktop closes the listener during normal shutdown as well.
